### What is mediator design pattern?
Mediator design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern, so it deals with the behaviors of objects. Mediator design pattern is used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.

In object-oriented programming, we should always try to design the system in such a way that components are loosely coupled and reusable. This approach makes our code easier to maintain and test.

In real life, however, we often need to deal with a complex set of dependent objects. This is when the Mediator Pattern may come in handy.

The intent of the Mediator Pattern is to reduce the complexity and dependencies between tightly coupled objects communicating directly with one another. This is achieved by creating a mediator object that takes care of the interaction between dependent objects. Consequently, all the communication goes through the mediator.
