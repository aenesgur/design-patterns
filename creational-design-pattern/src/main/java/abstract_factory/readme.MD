### What is abstract factory design pattern?
The Abstract Factory pattern is a more complex way to create objects of related types without exposing the logic of their creation. For example, you can have an Abstract Factory interface that defines methods to create different products, such as createButton() and createCheckbox() . Then, you can have concrete classes that implement this interface and create specific types of products, such as WindowsFactory and MacFactory. The advantage of this pattern is that you can create families of products that are compatible with each other, and switch between them easily by changing the Abstract Factory instance. The Abstract Factory pattern also follows the open-closed principle, as you can add new types of products or families without modifying the existing code.

This factory class returns different subclasses based on the input provided and factory class uses if-else or switch statement to achieve this. In the Abstract Factory pattern, we get rid of if-else block and have a factory class for each sub-class. Then an Abstract Factory class that will return the sub-class based on the input factory class.
