### What is state design pattern?
The state pattern is one of the behavioral design patterns. A state design pattern is used when an Object changes its behavior based on its internal state. If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object and use the if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. The state pattern is used to provide a systematic and lose-coupled way to achieve this through Context and State implementations.


Thanks to the State design pattern, we can encapsulate the logic in dedicated classes, apply the Single Responsibility Principle and Open/Closed Principle, have cleaner and more maintainable code.
