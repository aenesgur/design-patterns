### What is adapter design pattern?

Adapter pattern works as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces. This type of design pattern comes under structural pattern as this pattern combines the capability of two independent interfaces.

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces. A real life example could be a case of card reader which acts as an adapter between memory card and a laptop. You plugin the memory card into card reader and card reader into the laptop so that memory card can be read via laptop.


#### Purpose of usage;

It allows us to use two incompatible interfaces together.

We do not have to edit previously written codes. After all, we accept that the relevant code worked before.

Since we do not make any changes to the class we will adapt, we do not need to make changes anywhere in the application where it is used.
