### What is template method design pattern?
Template method design pattern is to define an algorithm as a skeleton of operations and leave the details to be implemented by the child classes. The overall structure and sequence of the algorithm are preserved by the parent class.


Template method defines the steps to execute an algorithm and it can provide default implementation that might be common for all or some of the subclasses. Let’s understand this pattern with an example, suppose we want to provide an algorithm to build a house. The steps need to be performed to build a house are - building foundation, building pillars, building walls and windows. The important point is that the we can’t change the order of execution because we can’t build windows before building the foundation. So in this case we can create a template method that will use different methods to build the house. Now building the foundation for a house is same for all type of houses, whether its a wooden house or a glass house. So we can provide base implementation for this, if subclasses want to override this method, they can but mostly it’s common for all the types of houses. To make sure that subclasses don’t override the template method, we should make it final.
