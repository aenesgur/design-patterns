### What is prototype pattern?

A Prototype Design Pattern is a creational pattern that helps to create new objects by copying an existing object. This pattern is particularly useful when creating objects is complex or resource-intensive. 

It is possible to see its use especially in game software. For example, while there are hundreds of the same soldiers in a war game, only the identification numbers of these soldiers differ. Instead of creating a soldier object from scratch each time and filling the constructor with the necessary information over and over again, existing soldier objects are copied and only their ID numbers, etc. are added using the set method. Information that will change, such as, is changed.

In Java, the concepts of shallow copy and deep copy determine how to behave when copying objects. Here are some examples of when shallow and deep copy should be preferred:

### Shallow Copy:
* Shallow copy is a type of copy in which only the reference is copied and the contents of the original object point to the same memory address.
* Shallow copy shares reference between objects, meaning that when the original object or its copy is changed, the other changes.
* Shallow copy uses less memory and processor resources.


### Deep Copy:
* Deep copy is a type of copy in which the contents of the original object are copied to a completely new memory area.
* Deep copy shares no references between objects, so changing the original object or its copy does not affect the other.
* Deep copy can use more memory and processor resources.


### Pros and Cons of the Prototype Pattern
#### Pros:
Easy Object Cloning: The pattern enables you to create new objects by copying existing ones, which promotes code reuse. This is especially beneficial when objects have complex or resource-intensive initialization processes.

Reduced Initialization Overhead: Since objects are cloned instead of being created from scratch, it can significantly reduce the overhead associated with expensive object initialization.

Individual Customization: Cloned objects can be easily customized to suit specific requirements while retaining the common characteristics of the prototype. This allows for flexibility in object creation.

Streamlined Object Creation: The pattern provides a structured and consistent way to create objects, making the codebase more organized and easier to maintain.

Minimized Complex Object Creation Logic: The Prototype Pattern abstracts the complex object creation logic away from the client code, leading to cleaner and more readable code.

#### Cons:
Shallow vs Deep Copy: In scenarios where objects contain references to other objects (e.g., nested objects), cloning might result in shallow copies by default. This means that changes to the nested objects in a cloned object can affect the original object and vice versa. Deep copying may be required, which can be complex to implement.

Managing Object State: If an object has an internal state that should not be shared across clones, careful management of the object state is necessary to ensure that each clone maintains its integrity.

Creating Concrete Prototypes: Implementing the Prototype Pattern often involves creating concrete prototype classes and customizing their clone methods. This can introduce additional classes and complexity.

Limited Applicability: The Prototype Pattern is most suitable when the cost of creating objects from scratch is high. In cases where object creation is relatively simple and inexpensive, using the pattern may introduce unnecessary complexity.

Compatibility with Serialization: If you need to clone objects that are serializable, you might encounter challenges related to object serialization and deserialization.
