### What is composite design pattern?

The composite design pattern is a structural design pattern that allows objects to be combined in a tree structure. This pattern defines two main types of objects, representing simple objects (leafs) and complex objects (compositions). The compositions may contain other compositions or leafs.

The main purpose of the Composite design pattern is to represent the hierarchical structure of objects. This pattern organizes objects in a tree structure, allowing client code to handle simple and complex objects the same way.

##### The advantages of the Composite design pattern are:

It makes it easier to represent the hierarchical structure of objects.

It allows client code to handle simple and complex objects the same way.

Increases application reusability and flexibility.

##### Example applications of the Composite design pattern are:

file system

menu system

organizational hierarchy

network structure
