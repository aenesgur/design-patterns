### What is facade design pattern?

The Facade design pattern is a structural design pattern used to hide the complexity of a software system and present a simpler interface. This design pattern aims to cover a number of subsystems in the system with a single easily usable interface.

It is a design pattern designed to make usage easier by abstracting the classes that form the parts of a subsystem from the client. From an architectural perspective, it is a structure that organizes a complex and detailed system and presents it to clients as a whole.
